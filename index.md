### My Cats （updated on March 09, 2020）

> I have two lovely cats, a 15-months-old cute girl Xiang-Xiang (Munchkin British Short hair) and a 6-months-old gentleman Da-Ju (Chinese Garden Cat). Xiang-Xiang is an inherited name from my grandmother's dog, and both of them left me for over 15 years. Xiang-Xiang followed me moving to different places for many times, so she has a blood of brave. I adopted Da-Ju the last autumn ffrom my colleague's back yard, he is greedy and super-active. I love them so much as the same as I appreciate my life.
